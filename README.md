# PowerShell-ISE-Solarized-Theme
A PowerShell Solarized Theme for the ISE that will do the Console as well as the Scripting Pane. Most solarized themes do not make it dark on both the Console and Scripting pane and I personally like that darkness very much. The internet however could not help me very much in getting it to work correctly. I got it working eventually and here is the result :) (mostly for personal use)

## How to use 

Open PowerShell ISE, then go to **Tools -> Options -> Manage Themes -> Import** and select the downloaded ps1xml theme from here :)

**Be warned as some people may not like that both the Console and Scripting pane will be edited**
